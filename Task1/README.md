Assumptions:
i)
I have assumed a fixed hashMap as input:
 [{1,10.0},{2,20.0},{3,25.0},{4,45.0},{5,0.0}]
and default percentageTotal=100.0

Users can edit these values and rerun the task

ii) Another assumption the program relies on is that the Math.random() mostly returns different value for every call
